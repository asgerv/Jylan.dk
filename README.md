# Jylan.dk
ASP.NET MVC 5 Application<br />
My friend wanted a simple website for his small LAN party, and I decided that to make my first ASP.NET project. I have a general knowledge about C# and .NET, but not alot of experience with web design or programming, so this was/is an exciting challenge for me, and a good way to learn.
## Requirements/Features:
* Attendees should be able to sign up for the next event/lan party.
  * It should be easy to sign up, so people bother use it.
* Display who signed up.
* Display information about the LAN, and the next event.
* Basic admin functions
  * Keep track of who has payed. A signup/person can be marked as "has payed".
  * Creating and/or updating event(s).
  * Editing information about the lan party.
